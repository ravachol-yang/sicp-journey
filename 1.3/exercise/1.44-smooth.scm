;; Exercise 1.44: The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing.
;; If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function whose value at a point x is the average of f ( x âˆ’ d x ) , f ( x ) ,
;; and f ( x + d x ) . Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f .
;; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed function.
;; Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.

(define dx 0.00001)

(define (smooth f)
  (lambda (x)
          (/ (+ (f (- x dx))
                (f x)
                (f (+ x dx))) 3)))

(define (repeated f n)
  (if (= 1 n)
      f
      (compose f (repeated f (- n 1)))))

(define (smooth-nth f n)
  ((repeated smooth n) f))
