* Preface
*TODO*

* Prerequisites & Environment
I'm working on archlinux and using the latest version of [[Y][Emacs]] as my editor, so this repo use Org as the language for notes. For Scheme implement, I use the latest version of [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket]].

** Racket language
*** Installation:
as stated in the offical doc [[https://download.racket-lang.org/]] or from your distro package manager.
*** Usage in SICP learning
*Racket* provides an [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html][SICP language package]], install it:
#+begin_src bash
raco pkg install sicp
#+end_src
use it in .rkt source file
#+begin_src racket
#lang sicp
#+end_src

** Emacs config
*** My Emacs dot file
My personal Emacs config [[https://github.com/ravachol-yang/emacs.d]], forked from [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][purcell/emacs.d]].
*** Racket specific support
Use [[https://www.racket-mode.com/][Racket Mode]] as Racket language support, which provides an Racket REPL and Racket syntax analysis.
To enable some advanced support, install these extra racket packages as stated in the *Racket Mode* offical docs:
#+begin_src bash
raco pkg install --auto data-lib errortrace-lib macro-debugger-text-lib rackunit-lib racket-index scribble-lib drracket-tool-text-lib
#+end_src
