;; Exercise 2.48: A directed line segment in the plane can be represented as a pair of
;; vectorsâ€”the vector running from the origin to the start-point of the segment,
;; and the vector running from the origin to the end-point of the segment.
;; Use your vector representation from Exercise 2.46 to define a representation
;; for segments with a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment.
