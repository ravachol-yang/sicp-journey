;; Exercise 2.34:
;; Fill in the following template to produce a procedure that evaluates a polynomial using Hornerâ€™s rule.
;; Assume that the coefficients of the polynomial are arranged in a sequence, from a 0 through a n .

(define
  (horner-eval x coefficient-sequence)
  (accumulate
   (lambda (this-coeff higher-terms)
     (+ this-coeff
        (* higher-terms x)))
   0
   coefficient-sequence))

(define (accumulate op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (accumulate op
                      initial
                      (cdr sequence)))))

;; For example, to compute 1 + 3 x + 5 x^3 + x^5 at x = 2 you would evaluate

(horner-eval 2 (list 1 3 0 5 0 1))
